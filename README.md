# cade-28
This directory contains software related to the CADE-28 conference.

Compiling the files SCIDTMain.hs, SCILTMain.hs, and SCILTMainurf.hs
with a Haskell compiler will produce the executables, which will output
a brief usage note when started in command line mode without arguments.

Any questions about the software can be directed to its author,
Taneli Huuskonen, by e-mail to taneli (at) op (dot) pl .
